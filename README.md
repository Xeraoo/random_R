# random_R

This repository contains a collection of random R scripts that I've come across or written during my journey of learning R programming. The scripts cover a wide range of topics, from basic data manipulation and visualization to more advanced statistical techniques. Each script serves as a small learning experiment, practice session, or exploration of a specific problem in R.

## Contents
- Various R scripts for data analysis, visualization, and random exercises
- Experimentation with R packages like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, etc.
- Some scripts may contain examples of basic statistical functions, plotting, or data wrangling

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a sandbox for learning and experimenting with different aspects of R programming. Feel free to explore, reuse, or contribute!

## How to Use
1. Browse the scripts to see different code examples.
2. Each script is self-contained and focuses on a specific task or problem.
3. Open and run the `.R` files in RStudio or any other R-compatible environment.

## Disclaimer
These scripts are for educational purposes and may not be optimized for production use.
